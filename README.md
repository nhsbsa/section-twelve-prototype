# NHS BSA Prototype Kit (Forked version of the NHS.UK prototype kit)

The NHS BSA Prototype Kit is a forked version of NHS.UK prototype kit (v 4.8.0) which enables you to make interactive prototypes that will look like pages on NHS.UK. The prototypes you make are a great way to show ideas to others and for conducting user research.

## Key Differences

The key difference between the NHS BSA Prototype Kit and the original NHS.UK Prototype Kit, is the addition of 2 new templates; 'Full Width' and 'Admin Interface'.

These patterns have been created to meet a need for a number of different NHS BSA internal services.

### Full Width
